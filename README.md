## Projects

### [Coffee Sales Analysis](https://github.com/cdevries380/coffee_sales_analysis)  
*SQL + Google Sheets*  

This project explores coffee sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and sales performance. 
Key analyses include:  
- **Beverage Sales (Pie Chart):** Shows which of the 8 beverage types sell the most.  
- **Sales by Hour (Line Graph):** Reveals peak hours when customers are most active.  

The insights can help a coffee shop make better decisions about promotions, inventory, and staffing.
